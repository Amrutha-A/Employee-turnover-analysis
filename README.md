# Employee-turnover-analysis
Performing different data analysis and training with ML models to analyze and predict employee turnover 
I have used the SMOTE technique to balance the classes and dummy data for analysis.
ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient boosting are used for performance analysis.
